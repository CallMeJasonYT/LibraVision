Project LibraVision is a modern library application aimed at enhancing the experience for both members and employees. 
It introduces a points system where members are rewarded or penalized based on their borrowing habits and overall behavior, unlocking privileges or prizes. Members can create personalized accounts to access tailored book recommendations based on their preferences. 
The application allows advanced book searches by title, author, ISBN, or keywords related to plot, genre, or characters. Users can view book summaries, reviews, and availability, reserve books for pickup, and track their borrowing history. 
Notifications alert members when return dates are near, enabling them to extend loans or schedule returns. Members can report damaged books during the borrowing period to avoid penalties. Points earned can be redeemed in a virtual gift shop featuring unique offers.
The app also integrates AR technology to enhance in-library experiences. Users can navigate aisles guided by virtual arrows to locate books or scan barcodes for instant access to reviews and descriptions. They can also report damages with visual evidence. 
Additionally, members can contribute to the library by donating books, money, or volunteering their time. Library employees benefit from dedicated features, including managing current and past loans, registering new loans, and viewing wear reports on books. 
They can also handle new member registrations, generating virtual membership cards automatically, and update the library database with new books. Employees can monitor upcoming reservations and ensure smooth library operations.

LibraVision leverages innovative features to create a seamless, engaging library experience, combining convenience, functionality, and modern technology to meet the needs of todayâ€™s library users.
